# Topcoder POC Chatbot Lambda Function

The endpoint for processing the Topcoder PoC Chatbot

## Deployment

Deployment instructions can be found in the ROOT folder

## Development

We are using standard as our lint style. `package.json` and `node_modules` folder need not be uploaded to lambda since there are only _devDependencies_. You only need to work on index.js file and copy the contents over to the lambda function
